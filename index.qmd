# Hello!

I am a statistician and infectious disease researcher based in Saint Paul, MN.
I currently work as a data scientist within the [CDC's Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html).
There, I am responsible for developing open-source software for forecasting disease outbreaks.

Prior to joining the CDC, I obtained a [PhD in statistics at UC Irvine](https://www.stat.uci.edu), where I was advised by [Volodymyr Minin](https://vnminin.github.io/index.html).
My [dissertation]((https://www.proquest.com/docview/2854278776)) focused on inference and forecasting using infectious disease surveillance data.
Before beginning graduate school in California, I completed my undergraduate and master's education in [mathematics and statistics](https://www.sdstate.edu/mathematics-and-statistics) at [South Dakota State University](https://www.sdstate.edu).

Outside of work, I spend my time playing [board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/Farge), watching [movies](https://letterboxd.com/Damon/), and volunteering with [Streets.mn](https://streets.mn).

My portrait was created by a wonderful artist at [The Iconfactory](https://iconfactory.com).
