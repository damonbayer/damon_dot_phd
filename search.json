    "text": "Hello!\nI am a statistician and infectious disease researcher based in Saint Paul, MN. I currently work as a data scientist within the CDC’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics. There, I am responsible for developing open-source tools for short-term forecasting of disease outbreaks.\nPrior to joining the CDC, I obtained a PhD in statistics at UC Irvine, where I was advised by Volodymyr Minin. My dissertation focused on inference and forecasting using infectious disease surveillance data. Before beginning graduate school in California, I completed my undergraduate and master’s education in mathematics and statistics at South Dakota State University.\nMy previous employment history includes a variety of positions at other government and government-adjacent agencies, including The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and The MITRE Corporation. I have lived with Type 1 Diabetes since childhood and applied my data science expertise in this domain at Tidepool and Glooko."
