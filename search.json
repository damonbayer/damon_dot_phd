    "text": "Hello!\nI am a statistician and infectious disease researcher based in Saint Paul, MN. I currently work as a data scientist within the CDC’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics. There, I am responsible for developing open-source software for forecasting disease outbreaks.\nPrior to joining the CDC, I obtained a PhD in statistics at UC Irvine, where I was advised by Volodymyr Minin. My dissertation focused on inference and forecasting using infectious disease surveillance data. Before beginning graduate school in California, I completed my undergraduate and master’s education in mathematics and statistics at South Dakota State University.\nOutside of work, I spend my time playing board games, watching movies, and volunteering with Streets.mn.\nMy portrait was created by a wonderful artist at The Iconfactory."
